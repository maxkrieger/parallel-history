# Parallel History

A browser extension that replaces your new tab page with history. A collaboration with the [Edvo](https://edvo.com) team.

## What it does

Parallel History shows temporal history on the left, and _relational_ history on the right.

It's an interface experiment where parallel views enable fluid scrolling of a fixed list, and salient surfacing of a dynamic list.

## Installation

## Development

Requires node, yarn, and Firefox.

### Setup

```
yarn
```

### Running

```
yarn start
```

### Building (for production)

```
yarn run build
```

## Further Work

- [ ] Infinite scroll (window'll fill up fast)
- [ ] Animations during reordering
- [ ] Self-similarity proximity (if two right column entries are related, make them proximate)
- [ ] URL Canonicalization
